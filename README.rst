Here we have all the programs from the two books:

*Implementing Discrete Mathematics: Combinatorics and Graph Theory with Mathematica*
by Steven S. Skiena, Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., Advanced Book Program,
350 Bridge Parkway, Redwood City CA 94065.  ISBN 0-201-50943-1.

This is the older two books and we have V0.9 code for that as ``CombinatoricaV0.9.m``

The revised edition of this is:

*Computational Discrete Mathematics: Combinatorics and Graph Theory in
Mathematica*, by Sriram V. Pemmaraju and Steven S. Skiena, Cambridge
University Press, 2003.

We have V.2.0 or that as ``CombinatoricaV201.m``

To run from inside Mathics3::

        $ git clone git@github.com:Mathic3/Mathics3-Package-Combinatorica.git
        $ cd Mathics3-Package-Combinatorica/Combinatorica

        $ mathics

        Mathics 7.0.1dev0
        on CPython 3.12.10 ...
        ...

        In[1]:= << "CombinatoricaV201"
        Out[1]= None

	In[2]:= Permutations[3]
	Out[2]= {{1, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 2}, {2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}, {3, 1, 2}, {3, 2, 1}}

	In[3]:= Permute[{A,B,C,D}, Permutations[3]]
	Out[3]= {{A, B, C}, {A, C, B}, {B, A, C}, {B, C, A}, {C, A, B}, {C, B, A}}

Although this version is newer, Mathics3 does hasn't yet caught up to the richer language that it uses. To use the version of the older book which handles graphics more completely::


        In[1]:= << "CombinatoricaV091"
        Out[1]= None

	In[2]:= LexicographicPermutations[{1,2,3}]
	Out[2]= {{1, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 2}, {2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}, {3, 1, 2}, {3, 2, 1}}

	In[3]:= LexicographicPermutations[{a,b,c}]
	Out[2]= {{A, B, C}, {A, C, B}, {B, A, C}, {B, C, A}, {C, A, B}, {C, B, A}}
